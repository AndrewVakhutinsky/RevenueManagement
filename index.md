Threshold multinomial logit model and its application to demand prediction
Zifeng Zhao
Abstract:
This paper proposes and studies the (random) threshold multinomial logit model, a discrete choice model with threshold effects. The newly proposed model incorporates the classical multinomial logit model and the recently proposed threshold Luce model as special cases. Under the threshold multinomial logit model, consumers first form their (heterogeneous) consideration set: If an alternative with significantly low utility is dominated by another one, it will not be included in the consideration set. The threshold multinomial logit model can alleviate the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property and allow more flexible substitution patterns. We characterize the optimal strategy and develop efficient solutions for the associated assortment optimization problems. Moreover, we develop maximum likelihood based estimation to calibrate the proposed threshold model and further establish its statistical properties such as asymptotic consistency and normality under mild conditions. An efficient EM algorithm is also developed to handle the scenario with incomplete sales data. Our numerical study on synthetic and real datasets shows that the new model can improve the goodness of fit and prediction accuracy of consumer choice behavior, which suggests the threshold effect should be taken into account in firms’ decision making.

Strategic Behavior for Hotel Standby Upgrade Programs: Empirical Evidence and Pricing Implications
Ovunc Yilmaz*, Mark Ferguson, Guangzhi Shang, Pelin Pekgün
*: Assistant Professor, Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder
Abstract:
Many hotels have recently started to offer standby upgrades (i.e., availability-based, discounted premium room upgrades) after the completion of booking to replace traditional front-desk upselling during check-in. However, customers, in particular loyalty members, may become knowledgeable about standby upgrades through repeated interactions, and act strategically, i.e., initially choose a standard room with the expectation of being offered a premium room discount through standby upgrades. Consequently, while enjoying the benefits of this program, hotels may face the potential cannibalization of premium sales due to such strategic behavior and need to adjust their pricing accordingly. Using a major hotel chain's 16-month booking and standby upgrades data, we empirically investigate the existence and extent of strategic customers in the context of standby upgrades. We develop a maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the percentage of customers who are strategic and find evidence of strategic behavior in three (out of eight) hotels examined. Considering both a weak-form and a strong-form strategic behavior, our estimates suggest that 12% to 42% of the loyalty customers act strategically in these three properties. We then propose a new pricing policy to help hoteliers maximize their premium room revenues from direct bookings and standby upgrade requests. This policy recommends a discounted full price, but also a higher standby upgrade price for loyalty customers, which can bring a revenue improvement of up to 19% over a policy ignoring the strategic behavior and 34% over a policy assuming that all customers are strategic -- two reasonable benchmarks without an estimate of the fraction of strategic customers.

Discrete-choice Predictive Model for the Hotel Room Upsell Process
Aydin Alptekinoglu, Natalia Kosilova

Abstract:
Upselling is a sales technique used to motivate a customer to purchase a more expensive option than the one that the customer initially chooses. When carefully implemented, it can considerably improve revenues in the hospitality industry. We propose a simple and tractable framework based on the Multinomial Logit model (MNL) that employs the information about the customer’s initial choice to better understand their idiosyncratic reaction to an upsell offer, and compute the optimal upselling strategy of a firm providing hospitality services. We first analyze the case where the firm upsells a single product to a customer. We characterize the optimal upsell price for any product the firm may choose to offer as an upsell item. We also generalize our framework to allow the firm to offer a portfolio of upsell offers simultaneously and develop the customer choice probabilities for this case. We estimate the generalized model on a real dataset provided by our industry partner, Nor1 (now part of Oracle’s Hotel Business Unit), which provides upselling solutions in the hospitality industry. We demonstrate that our model adequately explains consumer behavior.  Contribution of our paper is two-fold. First of all, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to consider an upsell problem with multiple products. Second, we provide a tractable, convenient and readily implementable framework to calculate the optimal upsell strategy (which product to offer and at what price). Since our framework is based on MNL, the model parameters required for computing the  terms of the optimal upsell offer can be estimated by well-known techniques that practitioners already  use, and the application of our method appears straightforward.  
Aydın Alptekinoğlu is a Professor of Supply Chain Management and Robert G. Schwartz University Endowed Fellow in Business Administration at Penn State’s Smeal College of Business. He holds a Ph.D. in Operations Management from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.  His broad research interest is in three dimensions of product strategy: Variety, Price, and Availability.  That is, what products to offer, at what price, and when and how to deliver them or make them available?  The major emphasis of his research program has been on the first dimension: product variety management, which he broadly views as including retail assortment planning, mass customization, product competition, new product introduction, and “old” product deletion (aka stock keeping unit rationalization).  As a natural outgrowth of his research on product variety management, he has recently developed a strong interest in the analytics of choice and returns – often a consequence of choice mismatches that emanate from lack of variety.  He is currently teaching a capstone course to Smeal seniors majoring in supply chain management, and a Ph.D. course on the tools (e.g., discrete choice theory) and topics (e.g., product variety management) that fall under operations-marketing interface research.  He is also serving as the Director of Research at Penn State’s Center for Supply Chain Research.

Demand estimation with missing data on covariates: Imputation-based approach

Abstract:
Discrete choice modeling has been widely used in academia and industry to understand the demand of customers for a product. When collecting data for demand estimation, however, it is often found that only purchased product records are available in practice. In the hotel industry, for example, booking records such as purchased rooms, purchased room prices, and purchased room features are only observed, while prices of other alternative rooms available when a purchase is made (that is, prices of alternative rooms in a choice set) are not recorded. In this case, discrete choice models are not applicable unless prices and other features of alternative rooms in a choice set are imputed. One may use historical data, which also consists of purchased records but was collected during a previous time period, to impute those alternative room features. However, without adjusting for heterogeneity between the current and historical data due to the time lag, naïve imputation based on historical data could bring another source of bias. In this study, we propose a semiparametric model approach based on joint modeling for demand patterns and features of products in a choice set from the two different data sources. Imputation for missing data is embedded in the process of estimating the model parameters, which adjusts for the bias associated with such partially missing information. We apply our proposed method to a real hotel transaction dataset provided by Oracle Hospitality Global Business Unit.  



Joint price optimization and hotel room assignment problem
Andrew Vakhutinsky, Jason Bryant
Abstract:
The hotel room assignment problem is an NP-hard problem that in some situations the hotel operator has to solve online as the future demand may not be known even on the arrival day.  In addition to that, the hotel operator may be offering paid upgrade to some customers, which makes the demand even more uncertain.  We formulate the room assignment problem as the joint revenue and inventory management problem and propose solution methods to optimize the price for both initial booking and check-in upgrade when the inventory is constrained for one or more hotel room categories.   We develop our approach to be independent of the underlying demand model and consider its long-term and real-time implementations.  We also discuss special business cases like pricing of the last room availability condition in the negotiated account rates.   Finally, we present the results of the computational experiments using real-life hotel booking data.
